## 🧠 How It Works-
1) All data is stored using the browser’s localStorage, so your records remain even after refreshing.
2) The filters allow quick sorting of data by site or waste type.
3) The CSV export feature converts your entries into a downloadable file.
4) The edit and delete buttons make it easy to manage your list in real-time.
5) The UI uses glassmorphism, gradients, and smooth animations for a futuristic design.
